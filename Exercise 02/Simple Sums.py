"""
In this exercise, you will create and work with integer variables, perform arith-
metic operations, and print the result to the console.

Steps:
1. Declare a variable and initialize it with the integer value 8.
2. Declare a second variable and initialize it with the integer value 10.
3. Declare a third variable that stores the sum of first two numbers.
4. Print the value of the sum to the console.
"""

# The integer 8 is assigned to a variable called num1
num1 = int(8)
# The integer 10 is assigned to a variable called num2
num2 = int(10)
# The variable num1 and num2 is been computed together using the operator plus (+) and was assigned to a variable sum1
sum1 = num1 + num2
# The statement has been printed with the "string" and combined with the variable sum1
print(sum1)
